TDD, Modularization, Proper design patterns
<br>

Breaking responsibilities into multiple protocols (Interface Segregation Principle) to achieve flexible, composable and modular components.
<br>

Combining Xcode projects into a workspace and embedding frameworks to compose modules into a running iOS app.
<br>

Testing component behavior with the Stub test-double
<br>

Creating a flexible and modular strategy for loading data from remote with fallback logic without altering the services or the clients (Open/Closed Principle).
<br>

Composing objects that share a common interface with the Composite Design Pattern
<br>

Isolating side-effects to create simple, testable, and composable operations (Command-Query Separation Principle).
<br>

Using the Decorator Design Pattern to intercept and inject side-effects in the system composition, supporting single-purpose, testable, and modular components.
<br>

Using the Decorator Design Pattern to extend the behavior of a component without altering it (Open/Closed Principle).
<br>

Subclassing and extending components to remove conditional logic resulting in clean, decoupled, maintainable, and testable components.
<br>

Validating acceptance criteria with Integration Tests.
<br>

Replacing UI Tests with significantly faster and thorough Integration Tests.
<br>

Simulating app launch and state transitions during tests
<br>

Testing methods that cannot be invoked
<br>

Rendering views without running the app
<br>

UITableViewCell reuse cycle
<br>

Vertical modular slicing by features to physically separate components in order to avoid crossing boundaries
<br>

Organizing the codebase into independent frameworks and projects
